<p class="drama">
KENT.<br/>
I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.
</p>

<p class="drama">
GLOUCESTER.<br/>
It did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of the kingdom, it
appears not which of the Dukes he values most, for qualities are so weighed
that curiosity in neither can make choice of either’s moiety.
</p>

<p class="drama">
KENT.<br/>
Is not this your son, my lord?
</p>

<p class="drama">
GLOUCESTER.<br/>
His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have so often
blush’d to acknowledge him that now I am braz’d to’t.
</p>

<p class="drama">
KENT.<br/>
I cannot conceive you.
</p>

<p class="drama">
GLOUCESTER.<br/>
Sir, this young fellow’s mother could; whereupon she grew
round-wombed, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she
had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?
</p>

<p class="drama">
KENT.<br/>
I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper.
</p>

<p class="drama">
GLOUCESTER.<br/>
But I have a son, sir, by order of law, some year elder than
this, who yet is no dearer in my account: though this knave came
something saucily to the world before he was sent for, yet was
his mother fair; there was good sport at his making, and the
whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this noble gentleman,
Edmund?</p>

<p class="drama">
EDMUND.<br/>
No, my lord.
</p>

<p class="drama">
GLOUCESTER.<br/>
My Lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my honourable friend.
</p>

<p class="drama">
EDMUND.<br/>
My services to your lordship.
</p>

<p class="drama">
KENT.<br/>
I must love you, and sue to know you better.
</p>

<p class="drama">
EDMUND.<br/>
Sir, I shall study deserving.
</p>

<p class="drama">
GLOUCESTER.<br/>
He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again. The King
is coming.
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Sennet within.</i>]</p>

<p class="drama">
LEAR.<br/>
Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.<br/>
Give me the map there. Know that we have divided<br/>
In three our kingdom: and ’tis our fast intent<br/>
To shake all cares and business from our age;<br/>
Conferring them on younger strengths, while we<br/>
Unburden’d crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,<br/>
And you, our no less loving son of Albany,<br/>
We have this hour a constant will to publish<br/>
Our daughters’ several dowers, that future strife<br/>
May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,<br/>
Great rivals in our youngest daughter’s love,<br/>
Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,<br/>
And here are to be answer’d. Tell me, my daughters,—<br/>
Since now we will divest us both of rule,<br/>
Interest of territory, cares of state,—<br/>
Which of you shall we say doth love us most?<br/>
That we our largest bounty may extend<br/>
Where nature doth with merit challenge.—Goneril,<br/>
Our eldest born, speak first.
</p>

<p class="drama">
GONERIL.<br/>
Sir, I love you more than word can wield the matter;<br/>
Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty;<br/>
Beyond what can be valu’d, rich or rare;<br/>
No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;<br/>
As much as child e’er lov’d, or father found;<br/>
A love that makes breath poor and speech unable;<br/>
Beyond all manner of so much I love you.
</p>

<p class="drama">
CORDELIA.<br/>
[<i>Aside.</i>] What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LEAR.<br/>
Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,<br/>
With shadowy forests and with champains rich’d,<br/>
With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,<br/>
We make thee lady: to thine and Albany’s issue<br/>
Be this perpetual.—What says our second daughter,<br/>
Our dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall? Speak.
</p>

<p class="drama">
REGAN.<br/>
Sir, I am made of the self mettle as my sister,<br/>
And prize me at her worth. In my true heart<br/>
I find she names my very deed of love;<br/>
Only she comes too short, that I profess<br/>
Myself an enemy to all other joys<br/>
Which the most precious square of sense possesses,<br/>
And find I am alone felicitate<br/>
In your dear highness’ love.
</p>

<p class="drama">
CORDELIA.<br/>
[<i>Aside.</i>] Then poor Cordelia,<br/>
And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love’s<br/>
More ponderous than my tongue.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LEAR.<br/>
To thee and thine hereditary ever<br/>
Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;<br/>
No less in space, validity, and pleasure<br/>
Than that conferr’d on Goneril.—Now, our joy,<br/>
Although the last and least; to whose young love<br/>
The vines of France and milk of Burgundy<br/>
Strive to be interess’d; what can you say to draw<br/>
A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
</p>

<p class="drama">
CORDELIA.<br/>
Nothing, my lord.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LEAR.<br/>
Nothing?
</p>

<p class="drama">
CORDELIA.<br/>
Nothing.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LEAR.<br/>
Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.
</p>

<p class="drama">
CORDELIA.<br/>
Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave<br/>
My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty<br/>
According to my bond; no more nor less.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LEAR.<br/>
How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,<br/>
Lest you may mar your fortunes.
</p>

<p class="drama">
CORDELIA.<br/>
Good my lord,<br/>
You have begot me, bred me, lov’d me: I<br/>
Return those duties back as are right fit,<br/>
Obey you, love you, and most honour you.<br/>
Why have my sisters husbands if they say<br/>
They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,<br/>
That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry<br/>
Half my love with him, half my care and duty:<br/>
Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,<br/>
To love my father all.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LEAR.<br/>
But goes thy heart with this?
</p>

<p class="drama">
CORDELIA.<br/>
Ay, my good lord.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LEAR.<br/>
So young, and so untender?
</p>

<p class="drama">
CORDELIA.<br/>
So young, my lord, and true.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LEAR.<br/>
Let it be so, thy truth then be thy dower:<br/>
For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,<br/>
The mysteries of Hecate and the night;<br/>
By all the operation of the orbs,<br/>
From whom we do exist and cease to be;<br/>
Here I disclaim all my paternal care,<br/>
Propinquity and property of blood,<br/>
And as a stranger to my heart and me<br/>
Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,<br/>
Or he that makes his generation messes<br/>
To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom<br/>
Be as well neighbour’d, pitied, and reliev’d,<br/>
As thou my sometime daughter.
</p>

<p class="drama">
KENT.<br/>
Good my liege,—
</p>

<p class="drama">
LEAR.<br/>
Peace, Kent!<br/>
Come not between the dragon and his wrath.<br/>
I lov’d her most, and thought to set my rest<br/>
On her kind nursery. [<i>To Cordelia.</i>] Hence and avoid my sight!<br/>
So be my grave my peace, as here I give<br/>
Her father’s heart from her! Call France. Who stirs?<br/>
Call Burgundy! Cornwall and Albany,<br/>
With my two daughters’ dowers digest this third:<br/>
Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.<br/>
I do invest you jointly with my power,<br/>
Pre-eminence, and all the large effects<br/>
That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,<br/>
With reservation of an hundred knights,<br/>
By you to be sustain’d, shall our abode<br/>
Make with you by due turn. Only we shall retain<br/>
The name, and all the addition to a king; the sway,<br/>
Revenue, execution of the rest,<br/>
Beloved sons, be yours; which to confirm,<br/>
This coronet part between you.
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Giving the crown.</i>]</p>

<p class="drama">
KENT.<br/>
Royal Lear,<br/>
Whom I have ever honour’d as my king,<br/>
Lov’d as my father, as my master follow’d,<br/>
As my great patron thought on in my prayers.—
</p>

<p class="drama">
LEAR.<br/>
The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.
</p>

<p class="drama">
KENT.<br/>
Let it fall rather, though the fork invade<br/>
The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly<br/>
When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?<br/>
Think’st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,<br/>
When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour’s bound<br/>
When majesty falls to folly. Reverse thy state;<br/>
And in thy best consideration check<br/>
This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgement,<br/>
Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;<br/>
Nor are those empty-hearted, whose low sounds<br/>
Reverb no hollowness.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LEAR.<br/>
Kent, on thy life, no more.
</p>

<p class="drama">
KENT.<br/>
My life I never held but as a pawn<br/>
To wage against thine enemies; ne’er fear to lose it,<br/>
Thy safety being the motive.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LEAR.<br/>
Out of my sight!
</p>

<p class="drama">
KENT.<br/>
See better, Lear; and let me still remain<br/>
The true blank of thine eye.

<p class="drama">
LEAR.<br/>
Hear me, recreant! on thine allegiance, hear me!<br/>
Since thou hast sought to make us break our vows,<br/>
Which we durst never yet, and with strain’d pride<br/>
To come betwixt our sentences and our power,<br/>
Which nor our nature, nor our place can bear,<br/>
Our potency made good, take thy reward.<br/>
Five days we do allot thee for provision,<br/>
To shield thee from disasters of the world;<br/>
And on the sixth to turn thy hated back<br/>
Upon our kingdom: if, on the next day following,<br/>
Thy banish’d trunk be found in our dominions,<br/>
The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,<br/>
This shall not be revok’d.
</p>

<p class="drama">
KENT.<br/>
Fare thee well, King: sith thus thou wilt appear,<br/>
Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.<br/>
[<i>To Cordelia.</i>] The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,<br/>
That justly think’st and hast most rightly said!<br/>
[<i>To Goneril and Regan.</i>] And your large speeches may your deeds
approve,<br/>
That good effects may spring from words of love.<br/>
Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;<br/>

<p class="drama">

My Lord of Burgundy,<br/>
We first address toward you, who with this king<br/>

But now her price is fall’n. Sir, there she stands:<br/>
If aught within that little-seeming substance,<br/>
Or all of it, with our displeasure piec’d,<br/>
And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,<br/>
She’s there, and she is yours.

BURGUNDY.<br/>
Pardon me, royal sir;<br/>
Election makes not up in such conditions.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LEAR.<br/>
Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,<br/>
I tell you all her wealth. [<i>To France</i>] For you, great king,<br/>
I would not from your love make such a stray<br/>
To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you<br/>
T’avert your liking a more worthier way<br/>
Than on a wretch whom nature is asham’d<br/>
Almost t’acknowledge hers.

The argument of your praise, balm of your age,<br/>
The best, the dearest, should in this trice of time<br/>
Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle<br/>
So many folds of favour. Sure her offence<br/>
Must be of such unnatural degree<br/>
That monsters it, or your fore-vouch’d affection<br/>
Fall into taint; which to believe of her<br/>
Must be a faith that reason without miracle<br/>
Should never plant in me.

CORDELIA.<br/>
I yet beseech your majesty,<br/>
If for I want that glib and oily art<br/>
To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,<br/>
I’ll do’t before I speak,—that you make known<br/>
It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,<br/>
No unchaste action or dishonour’d step,<br/>
That hath depriv’d me of your grace and favour;<br/>
But even for want of that for which I am richer,<br/>
A still soliciting eye, and such a tongue<br/>
As I am glad I have not, though not to have it<br/>

Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?<br/>
She is herself a dowry.

not as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to me, that

waked him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and live

These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us:
though the wisdom of Nature can reason it thus and thus, yet
nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects. Love cools,
friendship falls off, brothers divide: in cities, mutinies; in
countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond cracked
’twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the
prediction; there’s son against father: the King falls from
bias of nature; there’s father against child. We have seen the
best of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all
ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out
this villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it
carefully.—And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his

This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are

if we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion;
knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance;
drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience of
planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine
thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his
goatish disposition to the charge of a star. My father compounded
with my mother under the dragon’s tail, and my nativity was under
Ursa Major, so that it follows I am rough and lecherous. Fut! I

<h3><b>SCENE I. A Heath</b></h3>

<p class="scenedesc">A storm with thunder and lightning. Enter <span

severally.</p>

<p class="drama">
KENT.<br/>
Who’s there, besides foul weather?
</p>

<p class="drama">
GENTLEMAN.<br/>
One minded like the weather, most unquietly.
</p>

<p class="drama">
KENT.<br/>
I know you. Where’s the King?
</p>

<p class="drama">
GENTLEMAN.<br/>
Contending with the fretful elements;<br/>
Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea,<br/>
Or swell the curled waters ’bove the main,<br/>
That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,<br/>
Which the impetuous blasts with eyeless rage,<br/>
Catch in their fury and make nothing of;<br/>
Strives in his little world of man to outscorn<br/>
The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.<br/>
This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,<br/>
The lion and the belly-pinched wolf<br/>
Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,<br/>
And bids what will take all.
</p>

KENT.<br/>
But who is with him?
</p>

GENTLEMAN.<br/>
None but the fool, who labours to out-jest<br/>
His heart-struck injuries.

<p class="drama">
KENT.<br/>
Sir, I do know you;<br/>
And dare, upon the warrant of my note<br/>
Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,<br/>
Although as yet the face of it be cover’d<br/>
With mutual cunning, ’twixt Albany and Cornwall;<br/>
Who have, as who have not, that their great stars<br/>
Throne’d and set high; servants, who seem no less,<br/>
Which are to France the spies and speculations<br/>
Intelligent of our state. What hath been seen,<br/>
Either in snuffs and packings of the Dukes;<br/>
Or the hard rein which both of them have borne<br/>
Against the old kind King; or something deeper,<br/>
Whereof, perchance, these are but furnishings;—<br/>
But, true it is, from France there comes a power<br/>
Into this scatter’d kingdom; who already,<br/>
Wise in our negligence, have secret feet<br/>
In some of our best ports, and are at point<br/>
To show their open banner.—Now to you:<br/>
If on my credit you dare build so far<br/>
To make your speed to Dover, you shall find<br/>
Some that will thank you making just report<br/>
Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow<br/>
The King hath cause to plain.<br/>
I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;<br/>
And from some knowledge and assurance<br/>
Offer this office to you.
</p>

<p class="drama">
GENTLEMAN.<br/>
I will talk further with you.
</p>

<p class="drama">
KENT.<br/>
No, do not.<br/>
For confirmation that I am much more<br/>
Than my out-wall, open this purse, and take<br/>
What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,<br/>
As fear not but you shall, show her this ring;<br/>
And she will tell you who your fellow is<br/>
That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!<br/>
I will go seek the King.
</p>

<p class="drama">
GENTLEMAN.<br/>
Give me your hand: have you no more to say?
</p>

<p class="drama">
KENT.<br/>
Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet:<br/>
That, when we have found the King, in which your pain<br/>
That way, I’ll this; he that first lights on him<br/>
Holla the other.

Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
